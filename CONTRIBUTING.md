# Contributing to the project

This guide is intended for providing information on contributing to the
codebase. As a first step, see [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Finding open issues

A list of `help-wanted` issues is maintained in the project's issue tracker.
These issues are good starting points for contributing to the project. Some of
them require in-depth knowledge about the technology in use.

Issues tagged with `good first issues` are very small issues that can help you
to get familiar with the codebase.
